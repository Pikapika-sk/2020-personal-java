For this the script will create a new file \"boot.img-Args.txt\" - as example for boot image - will copy in it values like this: \"--base 0x10000000 --pagesize 2048 --kernel_offset 0x00008000 --ramdisk_offset 0x01000000 --second_offset 0x00f00000 --tags_offset 0x00000100\". They will be shown on the screen also. At repacking all these are passed in command and the resulting image will work in these new phones. It has no impact on older platforms - I tested this myself, and for new platform was tested in zopo zp999 thread. Additionally I created a new script which will only show image infos, if there is no need to unpack it. I compiled again all binaries modules to support these extra arguments, and also I compiled the required modules for info script. I couldn't do it for OSX, but I have the repo with boot-info in my gihub if you can build it. Also mkbootimg has to be compiled again for OSX to accept extra arguments.\r\nLiviu"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bgcngm/mtk-tools/issues/comments/68488584","html_url":"https://github.com/bgcngm/mtk-tools/pull/8#issuecomment-68488584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bgcngm/mtk-tools/issues/8","id":68488584,"user":{"login":"bgcngm","id":1696148,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1696148?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm","html_url":"https://github.com/bgcngm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:05:24Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:05:24Z","body":"Yeah, it's a good idea, to show more info when repacking.
